I repeat things a lot as a manager, and it’s not something I realized before I jumped in a little over six months ago.

There’s news to proliferate, and especially when it’s something sensitive (eg. something about a new career ladder and new bonus structure getting rolled out at the same time), that’s telling the same story over and over again. It’s saying the same story so many times, you’re sure every human you know has heard it. Only to find out there’s still confusion.

There’s change management to handle. During a re-org you can tell your direct reports until you’re blue in the face about all the things that are happening behind the scenes, it’s not final, but you’re just giving a heads up. This is important for people that are changing teams or managers, they need time to grieve and process. In the weeks leading up to the change you’ve told the story over and over, you’re sure every human you know has heard it. Only to find out there’s still confusion.

This can be exhausting, especially if it’s all happening at the same time - ask me how I know. On the other side of the desk, I never really thought about this at all. My manager just gave me some tidbit of useful information and on I went.

Something I’ve noticed in all this, when I start to tell the first people about these things it’s like the first dress rehearsal of a high school play. By the last person my message is so polished that it might as well be a feature film at the hands of Oscar-winning editors. I’m sure this inconsistency doesn’t help, but it didn’t seem to matter where they were in the order of people I told this information.

After asking around, I got a great tip: set up a private channel with just your reports for information sharing when it’s appropriate for the whole group to talk together. You can do this for more than career ladders and change management. They can be transparency nuggets from anywhere. As a manager you’re privy to much more information, some of that simply shouldn’t be shared outward, but other things definitely should. If you see something coming that will help your team, start a new discussion in your channel. The more you share, the more it will get used.

Pretty soon you’ll find some questions about things going on around the company coming to the channel instead of DMs, that’s when you know you’ve won.
