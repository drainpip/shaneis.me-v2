I was ready for it. After more than 20 years of building on the web, I was ready for the next generation to handle things. I would be a shepherd, a leader, a manager of engineers! I won't miss coding all day, like everyone says I would. I've been doing this so long I'm ready to set it down. I've been mentoring as tech lead for years now, you just trust the smart people to do the thing and they'll do the thing, what else is there to it??

One day they're your peers, the next day you're their boss. There are suddenly power dynamics, and responsibilities for human beings. If the weight of it doesn't give you pause, perhaps you're not taking this seriously enough. The awesome responsibility to create an environment for those you're responsible for to thrive is a weight you feel in the early days of being a manager. It can rear its ugly head as sticky personality conflicts, or pay disparities, that are suddenly for you to solve. One day it'll hit you upside the head, and it'll happen randomly for the rest of the time you stay in this role. There are a lot of things you can do to help, but when I look back upon the beginning of my engineering management journey these are things I did right away (or wished I did earlier) to have a better footing.

### No more technical decisions

- the team makes the decisions, they're the experts
- to guide, ask questions
- only interrupt if they're going to touch fire

### Rabidly collect personal lives

- more than knowing what they did over the weekend, gives you a window into their general social health
- sacrosanct 1-1's, in spite of power CEOs leadership methods
- sharing is caring, connection gains trust

### Do the dirty work

- go to the meeting instead
- light fires to unblock
- have the difficult conversations, sometimes asking is all you need

#### P.S.

I feel very strongly that leaders should constantly learn leadership. It's never done and you'll never been an expert at all aspects of it (or any of it?). There are some great books that I've read that have either solidified my thinking, or have completely unraveled it. I am purposefully trying not to link to Amazon on purpose, however most (or all) of these are there too if you need.

If you're early in your journey, some of these books may help you with your transition, or even knowing if this transition is right for you before you take the plunge.

In no particular order:

* [Resilient Management - Lara Hogan](https://abookapart.com/products/resilient-management); My first management book, and still one of the ones I'm most fond of for its brevity and being packed full of practical things you can do today.
* [Design Is a Job - Mike Montiero](https://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job.html); not at all about management or engineering, however it will teach you lots of important things including how to sell work which is an underrated skill most don't have.
* [Radical Candor - Kim Scott](https://bookshop.org/p/books/radical-candor-be-a-kick-ass-boss-without-losing-your-humanity-kim-scott/8486942?ean=9781250235374); Possibly one of my favorites I've read, there are so many stories of lessons learned and practical applications of common issues I think this is a must read.
* [An Elegant Puzzle - Will Larson](https://bookshop.org/p/books/an-elegant-puzzle-systems-of-engineering-management-will-larson/18697762?ean=9781732265189); Such a fantastic book about thinking in organizations, which is something I haven't reached yet in my career, but I'll definitely re-read it when come closer.
* [Engineering Management For The Rest Of Us - Sarah Drasner](https://bookshop.org/p/books/engineering-management-for-the-rest-of-us/18891496?ean=9798986769318&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAACfld42sHceuKjP00LONMRkcdBPX1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvP-6BhDyARIsAJ3uv7YdCBSDwFM4M1_3Tix0Ofcjeihb9UCAdevdJdxd5bZv6zpf5XHI48gaAnI3EALw_wcB); Another on the list that's concise and chalk full of practical things you can start using right away.

My to-be-read as of December '24:

* [Thinking In Systems - Donella H. Meadows](https://bookshop.org/p/books/thinking-in-systems-international-bestseller-donella-meadows/8755142?ean=9781603580557)
* [The Making Of a Manager - Julie Zhuo](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-making-of-a-manager-what-to-do-when-everyone-looks-to-you-julie-zhuo/12476618?ean=9780735219564)
