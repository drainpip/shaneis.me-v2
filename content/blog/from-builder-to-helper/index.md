I was ready for it. After more than 20 years of building on the web, I was ready for the next generation to handle things. I would be a shepherd, a leader, a manager of engineers! I won't miss coding all day, like everyone says I would. I've been doing this so long I'm ready to set it down. I've been mentoring as tech lead for years now, you just trust the smart people to do the thing and they'll do the thing, what else is there to it??

One day they're your peers, the next day you're their boss. There are suddenly power dynamics, and responsibilities for human beings. If the weight of it doesn't give you pause, perhaps you're not taking this seriously enough. The awesome responsibility to create an environment for those you're responsible for to thrive is a weight you feel in the early days of being a manager. It can rear its ugly head as sticky personality conflicts, or pay disparities, that are suddenly for you to solve. One day it'll hit you upside the head, and it'll happen randomly for the rest of the time you stay in this role. There are a lot of things you can do to help, but when I look back upon the beginning of my engineering management journey these are things I did right away (or wished I did earlier) to have a better footing.

### No more technical decisions

You might actually be the most knowledgeable person on your team about the general systems and architecture of the code you've been in ever day on the day of your transition into management. On that day, though, the responsibilities of all technical decisions are no longer yours. You're accountable for all those decisions, but you're no longer responsible for them. I made a conscious and public effort to remove myself from all of these decisions, no matter how small. At the time our engineering organization was all about tech leads, so I placed who I thought would transition best into that role and announced it. I worked with them behind the scenes to ensure they were up to speed on the expectations of that role, and worked with the rest of the team to route all questions normally coming to me to the new person. This took some practice to get right.

If I remained in that role for the team it would have knock-on effects that lead to damaging trust with your team, one of the most important things you must foster as a leader. It shows your team they're not ready to drive, it takes away their agency. It would also give no one else the ability to rise to the challenge of added responsibility, and hopefully do things better than I had. Over time though, as you get more and more disconnected from the code, it'll be actually dangerous for you to make these decisions because you're no longer the expert. Starting this right away, in my opinion, is necessary.

Onboarding a new "tech lead", even if you don't have that role formally, when you transition to management is a boon in more than the obvious ways as well. You'll be swimming - perhaps drowning depending on the state of the team - in new responsibilities on day one. Having someone take that load away from you will a breath of fresh air. This is also your first direct mentorship relationship as a manager, one that's quite different from a peer. It'll give you practice talking about careers and their wants, needs, and goals in this new role. This will be a new skill, and one you'll get much better at over time.

If you do this right, you might find yourself in a position that you might not feel comfortable with: the team going in a direction you disagree with. A strong team doesn't *need* you for any technical decisions, but it doesn't mean it doesn't want your perspective. Of course you could sabotage everything you've built and force them to do what you want, but this breaks all the healthy parts of a team and will reset you back to zero with trust. To influence a team, all you really need to do is ask questions and make suggestions. Raise your hand with the attitude of: I have a point of view here, it could be right or wrong, what do you think? There will be agreement or pushback, but you're still giving the team agency to make the choice with this new information. Don't take it personal if they don't listen, or take all of what you say forward, after all they're the experts doing the work. I've found in general when I do this, the team hears me and brings this new information into the decision itself.

An important side bar which may or may not be obvious. When celebrating these decisions, it's important to use "they" language, or "the team" - they get all the credit when speaking to leadership or anyone outside the team. When talking about these decisions in challenging times, especially if they are controversial or perhaps lead to an outage of some type, it's very important to use "we" language - you're standing with them up against "the man".

### Rabidly collect personal lives

- more than knowing what they did over the weekend, gives you a window into their general social health
- sacrosanct 1-1's, in spite of power CEOs leadership methods
- sharing is caring, connection gains trust

### Do the dirty work

- go to the meeting instead
- light fires to unblock
- have the difficult conversations, sometimes asking is all you need
- don't ask someone to do something you wouldn't do

#### P.S.

I feel very strongly that leaders should constantly learn leadership. It's never done and you'll never been an expert at all aspects of it (or any of it?). There are some great books that I've read that have either solidified my thinking, or have completely unraveled it. I am purposefully trying not to link to Amazon on purpose, however I'm sure these are there too if you need.

If you're early in your journey, some of these books may help you with your transition, or even knowing if this transition is right for you before you take the plunge.

In no particular order:

* [Resilient Management - Lara Hogan](https://abookapart.com/products/resilient-management); My first management book, and still one of the ones I'm most fond of for its brevity and being packed full of practical things you can do today.
* [Design Is a Job - Mike Montiero](https://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job.html); not at all about management or engineering, however it will teach you lots of important things including how to sell work which is an underrated skill most don't have.
* [Radical Candor - Kim Scott](https://bookshop.org/p/books/radical-candor-be-a-kick-ass-boss-without-losing-your-humanity-kim-scott/8486942?ean=9781250235374); Possibly one of my favorites I've read, there are so many stories of lessons learned and practical applications of common issues I think this is a must read.
* [An Elegant Puzzle - Will Larson](https://bookshop.org/p/books/an-elegant-puzzle-systems-of-engineering-management-will-larson/18697762?ean=9781732265189); Such a fantastic book about thinking in organizations, which is something I haven't reached yet in my career, but I'll definitely re-read it when come closer.
* [Engineering Management For The Rest Of Us - Sarah Drasner](https://bookshop.org/p/books/engineering-management-for-the-rest-of-us/18891496?ean=9798986769318&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAACfld42sHceuKjP00LONMRkcdBPX1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvP-6BhDyARIsAJ3uv7YdCBSDwFM4M1_3Tix0Ofcjeihb9UCAdevdJdxd5bZv6zpf5XHI48gaAnI3EALw_wcB); Another on the list that's concise and chalk full of practical things you can start using right away.

My to-be-read as of December '24:

* [Thinking In Systems - Donella H. Meadows](https://bookshop.org/p/books/thinking-in-systems-international-bestseller-donella-meadows/8755142?ean=9781603580557)
