title: 'Expect No Loyalty'
description: 'A lot of words are used to describe times like this that let companies ignore the humans that make it possible for them to exist, and toss them away when times are tough but that is all it is. Navigating this when managing humans will likely be the hardest thing you do.'

My elder generation taught me to put in my time at a company, the loyalty will pay off in the end. That didn't turn out to be the case for even their generation, and everyone has wised up to that fact. Companies like to talk about people being their most important asset, some even calling them family, but they're consistently surprised when their people leave after a couple years to find more money, opportunities, better teams or leadership, the list goes on. They're surprised that people no longer give them loyalty, even when they're laying off percentages of their company that equate to thousands of people.

I expect no loyalty from the company I work for, and I expect no loyalty from the people that I manage. This clarifies what I want and what I need from the place I work and the people I work with. I will never hold it against someone when they give me their resignation, especially given historical precedent. There is no motivation for a person to remain in a role & company because companies don't give a reason to be motivated, in fact they do the opposite.

### Leapfrog culture

Even when companies are flush with cash and growth will never stop, most need to go somewhere else to move their career forward. In many situations this can be a good thing, but when the average person in tech is leaving a job after a couple years this is something more systemic. The reasons why are not necessarily unique to tech, but perhaps exacerbated by the high salaries.

I got into management for a lot of reasons, but one of the primary ones was understanding the mystery of promotions and pay raises. I'm now on the other side and can see the numbers, the negotiations, the reasoning, and I still don't understand why a company will refuse to pay someone what they're worth just because they were hired at the wrong number and pushing them to what they're worth makes an equation turn a cell red. The consequences to this are dire and obvious. They leave with all their hard-won company-specific experience and knowledge, a new person comes in which is probably great in their own way, but are making what the previous person wanted or much more. The expense of just that is enough to make me do a double take, but the cost of recruiting, interviewing, onboarding, training, and more add up to so much more than the previous person was asking for. If you can explain it to me and make me understand why it's better, systemically, I'm happy to be proven wrong.

Each time I bring up pay in situations like this, it's the same tune by the business. Money isn't everything, we can offer things other places can't. Perhaps that's true, but most of those things don't pay for keeping a roof over one's head. Yes, the team you work with is important, as well as your manager, people leave when those go wrong. However in a vast field of companies that can afford to attract solid programmers, your culture isn't as unique as you might think.

The unintended, or perhaps intended, consequence is to leapfrog your entire career. I cannot fault people for participating in it. I even consult people that report to me when a good time for their specific career it would be seen as a positive. The sad part about this is it would generally be cheaper to give people the motivation to stay, it would be better for people to stay and grow, learn new things and try new projects. It would help everyone level up by staying longer and going deeper on problems to give them the necessary knowledge of rising up to the heights possible with their careers. Companies that foster this type of environment will still lose people and gain people at a steady rate, but this should be a trickle relative to your size. New fresh eyes are critical at all levels of seniority, but if you have so few people with significant tenure that it's not even a percentage of a percent of your workforce you should ask yourself if your way is easier.

### Failure without consequences

- times like these
- hardest thing you can do as a manager, which is some small percentage of how bad it feels on the other side of the conversation
- complete and total failure in all things a company can fail at
- act like your position can be removed as soon as numbers go sideways and protect yourself
- failure in leadership has very few consequences
- how it feels in the weeks after

### This is not the way

- how to keep people happy?
- how to keep people challenged?
- manage from onboarding to offboarding, be part of the conversation during the end of their role
- healthy teams will celebrate the next step in their teammates career
- bring me along
